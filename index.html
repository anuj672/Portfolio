  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer who works at the intersection of software development and cloud infrastructure. I
      build REST APIs in Python/FastAPI, containerize them, and design CI/CD pipelines to deploy securely on AWS and GCP.
      My focus is end-to-end delivery: writing clean code, automating deployments, and ensuring systems are scalable, observable, and cost-efficient in production.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <div class="job">
      <h3>Software Engineer (DevOps Team) â€“ Colorcon</h3>
      <p><em>May 2024 â€“ Present</em></p>
      <p>
      At Colorcon, I modernized legacy systems and scaled cloud infrastructure to accelerate development and reduce costs. 
      I migrated 16 Oracle ADF applications into containerized FastAPI microservices, saving ~$45K annually and boosting developer productivity by 40%. 
      I also built Jenkins pipelines that automated 100% of deployments and integrated OpenTelemetry with Dynatrace, preventing 10+ incidents per month.
      I am currently working on shipping ML models to the cloud! This includes a color prediction model which will be containerized and deployed to Azure via Github Actions.
    </p>

    <div class="job">
      <h3>Software Engineer Intern â€“ Colorcon</h3>
      <p><em>Jan 2024 â€“ May 2024</em></p>
      <p>
      During this internship, I got hands-on with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, experimenting with deployment strategies and CI/CD optimizations. 
      I automated repetitive deployment tasks, giving the DBA team back 2+ hours per week. It was a great opportunity to bridge cloud services with real business needs and see instant impact.

    <div class="job">
      <h3>DevOps Engineer Intern â€“ Colorcon</h3>
      <p><em>Jun 2023 â€“ Aug 2023</em></p>
      <p>
        I focused on modernizing the CI/CD landscape. Migrating 16 applications from SVN to GitHub Enterprise improved collaboration, while automating Jenkins pipelines in Groovy and Bash directly saving $65K annually in subscription fee.
        This project taught me how small automation changes can yield big operational and financial benefits.

    <div class="job">
      <h3>DevOps Project Assistant â€“ NC State University</h3>
      <p><em>Aug 2023 â€“ Dec 2023</em></p>
      <p>
      At NCSU, I managed production backups for a 40+ GB system, using Bash, Python, cron jobs, and rsync. This wasnâ€™t just about scriptsâ€”it was about ensuring students and faculty never lost critical data.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="job">
      <h3>Cloud DevOps Engineer â€“ HSBC</h3>
      <p><em>Sep 2020 â€“ May 2022</em></p>
    <p>I handled 90+ cloud operational tickets weekly, covering Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, and GCP. Beyond execution, 
    I led GCP training sessions for colleagues across multiple countries, helping them understand cloud infrastructure and best practices. It was rewarding to combine hands-on problem-solving with knowledge sharing.
